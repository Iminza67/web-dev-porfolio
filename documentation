    Project: Personal Portfolio Website - HTML & CSS

    Documentation:
    This project was completed by Olivia Iminza Hamisi as part of an HTML and CSS assignment.
    All HTML structure, element layout, and fundamental styling concepts were implemented
    based on my prior knowledge and understanding of HTML and CSS, acquired through
    coursework, practice, and personal study. Personal study was done through the FreeCodeCamp website and
    youtube channel.

    I referred to online resources, such as MDN Web Docs, CSS Tricks, and Google search
    for general guidance on specific CSS properties and numerical values (e.g., padding,
    margins, font sizes) that would best achieve the desired aesthetic. Additionally,
    I used Google for style inspiration and validated code snippets to ensure best
    practices in web design.

    For precise measurements and some advanced styling effects, I consulted ChatGPT
    and other documentation. However, all code was personally customized and adapted
    to meet the assignment requirements and to fit within the dark blue theme of the
    website.

    Acknowledgments:
    -W3schools (for the advanced css and html tags to be used)
    - MDN Web Docs (general HTML/CSS documentation)
    - CSS Tricks (styling and layout ideas)
    - Google search for style references and numerical value suggestions
    - ChatGPT as a supplementary tool for understanding advanced concepts

    This documentation confirms that all work submitted is original and created by me,
    with external resources used solely for referencing and inspiration.
